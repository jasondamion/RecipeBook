# RecipeBook

This is an application I made using the Spoonacular API, JawsDB, NodeJS, JSDocs, Angular 7+, JWT, and more.
The purpose is to be able to search for recipes and save your favorite ones to find later. I made this because I find cooking to be exciting but I always lost the recipes that I plan on making so this way, I can keep track of them and I might as well let the application help others so I hope you enjoy!

## How it works

* First you signup or login.
* Then from there, you can look up different recipes, see random recipes, save your favorite ones and revisit them when it's time to chef it up!
